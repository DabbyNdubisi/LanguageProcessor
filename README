This outlines the operating instructions for our Syntax Parser
In order to provide a seamless process of loading the software,
we included a Makefile.

Operating Instructions
-----------------------
make
./parser


In order to view the created dependency tree as a png,
Ensure you have the graphviz software and dot installed

For any .dot file in the ./Parses directory, run the following:

dot -T png -O ./Parses/<dot File>.dot

This will create a png of the parse that can be viewed with your favoured
image reader.
